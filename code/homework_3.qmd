# Problem 1. Personal Data

## a. Data Summarizing

I could calculate the mean daily phone usage (response variable, continuous, minutes) and compare it between school days vs. non-school days (predictor variable, groups, yes/no). This comparison is informative because on school days I utilize my phone for educational material in addition to personal use, so I think I will have a greater mean daily usage on school days.

## b. Visualization

```{r}

# Clean the data
phone_data_clean <- phone_data %>%
  # Convert Duration to minutes
  mutate(
    # First fix the inconsistent formatting (HH:MM vs HH:MM:SS.000)
    Duration = str_replace(Duration, ":00\\.000$", ""),  # Remove seconds/milliseconds
    Duration = ifelse(str_count(Duration, ":") == 1, 
                     paste0("00:", Duration),  # Add hours if missing
                     Duration),
    # Convert to duration format then to total minutes
    Duration = as.numeric(hms(Duration))/60
  ) %>%
  # Select only the columns we want
  select(Duration, School_day) %>%
  # Convert School_day to logical (TRUE/FALSE)
  mutate(School_day = School_day == "Yes")

# Calculate summary statistics
summary_stats <- phone_data_clean %>%
  group_by(School_day) %>%
  summarise(
    mean = mean(Duration),
    median = median(Duration),
    n = n(),
    se = sd(Duration)/sqrt(n())
  )

# Create visualization
ggplot(phone_data_clean, aes(x = School_day, y = Duration, fill = School_day)) +
  # Add raw data points
  geom_jitter(width = 0.15, size = 3, alpha = 0.6, color = "#6A4C93") +
  
  # Add violin plot to show distribution shape
  geom_violin(width = 0.6, alpha = 0.3, color = NA) +
  
  # Add boxplot for quartiles
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.8, outlier.shape = NA) +
  
  # Add mean points
  geom_point(data = summary_stats, 
             aes(y = mean), 
             shape = 23, size = 5, 
             fill = "#FFA500", color = "black") +
  
  # Add mean labels
  geom_text(data = summary_stats,
            aes(y = mean, 
                label = paste0("Mean: ", round(mean, 1), " min")),
            vjust = -2.5, size = 4.5, fontface = "bold") +
  
  # Custom colors and labels
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#1982C4", "#8AC926"),
                    labels = c("Non-School Days", "School Days")) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Non-School Days", "School Days")) +
  
  # Titles and labels
  labs(
    title = "Phone Usage Duration: School Day vs. Non-School Day",
    subtitle = "Individual observations (purple) with distribution summary",
    x = "",
    y = "Daily Phone Usage (minutes)",
      round(t.test(Duration ~ School_day, data = phone_data_clean)$p.value, 3)) +
  
  # Theme adjustments
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    legend.position = "none",
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5, size = 16),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, color = "gray40"),
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, margin = margin(t = 10))
  ) 
```

## c. Caption

Figure 1. Daily phone usage duration comparison between school days (green) and non-school days (blue) shows individual observations (purple circles), distribution densities (violin plots), quartiles (boxplots), and mean values (orange diamonds).

## d. Table presentation

```{r}

# Calculate summary statistics from cleaned phone data
summary_table <- phone_data_clean %>%
  group_by(School_day) %>%  # Group data by school day status (TRUE/FALSE)
  
  # Calculate summary statistics for each group
  summarise(
    Mean = round(mean(Duration), 1),    # Average duration rounded to 1 decimal
    SD = round(sd(Duration), 1),        # Standard deviation
    Median = round(median(Duration), 1), # Median value
    Q1 = round(quantile(Duration, 0.25), 1), # First quartile (25th percentile)
    Q3 = round(quantile(Duration, 0.75), 1), # Third quartile (75th percentile)
    N = n()  # Count of observations in each group
  ) %>%
  
  # Convert logical School_day to descriptive labels
  mutate(School_day = ifelse(School_day, "School Day", "Non-School Day"))

# Create the flextable object
ft <- flextable(summary_table) %>%
  
  # Set clear column headers
  set_header_labels(
    School_day = "Day Type",
    Mean = "Mean (min)",
    SD = "SD (min)",
    Median = "Median (min)",
    Q1 = "Q1 (min)",
    Q3 = "Q3 (min)",
    N = "Days"
  ) %>%
  
  # Add a multi-level header to group related statistics
  add_header_row(
    values = c("", "Central Tendency", "Variability", "Quartiles", ""),
    colwidths = c(1, 2, 1, 2, 1)  # Column spans for header groups
  ) %>%
  
  # Apply visual styling
  theme_box() %>%  # Basic box theme
  bg(part = "header", bg = "#2C3E50") %>%  # Dark header background
  color(part = "header", color = "white") %>%  # White header text
  bold(part = "header") %>%  # Bold header text
  align(align = "center", part = "all") %>%  # Center-align all cells
  width(width = 0.8)  # Set column width
  

# Display the formatted table

# Problem 2. Affective visualization

## a. Describe in words what an affective visualization could look like for your personal data

For my affective visualization I would like to highlight the four main focal points essential to the viewer. First, the phone itself, acting as a border for the overall data. Second, a clear difference between the two categories using symbolism of each. Third, a display of the difference in means between the two categories. Lastly, it needs to be clear and concise with little visual clutter to distract from the data.

## b. Create a sketch (on paper) of your idea

![](images/sketch.jpg){width="500"}

## c. Make a draft of your visualization

![](images/draft.jpg){width="500"}

## d. Write an artist statement

I am showing the viewer an image of my personal phone, overlayed with a data visualization of phone usage between school days and non-school days. To separate the two categories, I created two sections next to one another that display the difference in mean daily phone usage and use symbols to distinguish between school vs. non-school days. I gained influence from Georgia, who worked on the project titled, *Week 50: A week of our phones*. I like how she included app icons and that made me realize I could use my own phone home screen to overlay the data, with some app icons kept at the top. My work was done in an app on my ipad that I typically take notes on. It was very interesting to see how I could use it with colors to create my art/visualization. To create my work I first made a sketch that I included in problem 2b based on my phone home screen, with the data overlayed. I then moved to my ipad where I recreated the sketch with color and filled in any missing details.

# Problem 3. Statistical critique

## a. Revisit and summarize

The authors use several statistical tests to analyze the relationship between Halimeda cover and thermal stress (degree heating weeks) while accounting for habitat differences. First, they apply linear mixed-effects models to evaluate the fixed effects of thermal stress and habitat while incorporating random site effects. Second, Pearsonâ€™s correlation tests assess linear relationships between Halimeda cover and thermal stress across reef zones. Third, pairwise comparisons (paired t-tests) examine site-specific temporal changes in cover. Finally, supplementary analyses (ANOVA) further validate habitat-related differences independent of thermal stress.

## b. Visual clarity

In the figure, the authors of the paper do an effective job visually representing their statistics. The x- and y-axes are logical, with the predictor variable (Degree Heating Weeks) on the x-axis and response variable (Percent cover of Halimeda) on the y-axis. The habitat key includes both categories, fore reef in red and reef terrace in yellow, with the points on the graph reflecting mean precentage for displayed year and standard error bars. However, model predictions and underlying raw data are not included.

## c. Aesthetic clarity

The authors handled visual "clutter" well, color coding the habitat types with distinct colors, not including any distracting grid lines, and displaying present but non-intrusive error bars. The only problems with visual "clutter" are the overlapping error bars and points on the left side of the graph, more of a function of data than design and mitigated with labeling. The data:ink ratio is high with no additional "ink" on the graph, a concise legend, and purposeful text.

## d. Recommendations

To make the figure better I would first consider adding a linear, or nonlinear regression line (with confidence intervals), separately for each habitat. This helps the viewer assess the relationship between the two variables and categories by reducing the noise that raw data points cause. I would also consider slightly jittering the overlapping points on the left side of the graph in order to reduce visual clutter. After, I would add a caption or footnote stating what the error bars represent in addition to including sample sizes for each year. These give the viewer additional information and clarity about the variability of the data shown. Lastly, I would consider splitting the habitats into two separate panels, one for fore reef and another for reef terrace. This would reduce color dependancy and make trends more clear within each habitat.
